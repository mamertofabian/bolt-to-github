### Issues

These are quick issues that I've found while testing the extension. These will be added as a GitHub issue later, unless it was fixed in the meantime.

- [BUG] After importing a private repository, clicking on use the same repository name uses the default branch, not the imported branch
- [IMPROVEMENT] Refactor the GitHubSettings.svelte component (633 lines is too long)
- [IMPROVEMENT] Refactor the ProjectsList.svelte component (631 lines is too long)
