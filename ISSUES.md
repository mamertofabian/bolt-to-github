### Issues

These are quick issues that I've found while testing the extension. These will be added as a GitHub issue later, unless it was fixed in the meantime.

- After importing a private repository, clicking on use the same repository name uses the default branch, not the imported branch
- Disable the GitHub button when pushing to GitHub or importing a repository
