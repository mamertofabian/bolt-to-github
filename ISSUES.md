### Issues

These are quick issues that I've found while testing the extension. These will be added as a GitHub issue later, unless it was fixed in the meantime.

- [BUG] After importing a private repository, clicking on use the same repository name uses the default branch, not the imported branch
- [BUG] Disable the GitHub button when pushing to GitHub or importing a repository
- [BUG] In the event that the progress status UI is not showing, "nudge" it to show.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Refactor the GitHubSettings.svelte component (633 lines is too long)
- [IMPROVEMENT] Refactor the ProjectsList.svelte component (631 lines is too long)
- [IMPROVEMENT] Add pagination to the ProjectsList.svelte component
- [CHECK] Check the auto-delete functionality of the temporary repository
