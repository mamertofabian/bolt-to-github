### Short-term Priority (Next 2 Sprints)

3. **UnifiedGitHubService**: Authentication strategies, token management, API operations
4. **TempRepoManager**: Cleanup logic, storage management, resource leaks

### Medium-term Priority (Next 3-4 Sprints)

5. **GitHubAppService**: OAuth flows, token lifecycle, error handling
6. **AnalyticsService**: Service worker compatibility, event delivery, consent management
7. **MessageHandler**: Queue management, connection validation, memory usage

### Testing Implementation Notes

1. **Mock Strategy**: Focus on Chrome API mocking, network request interception, and timer manipulation
2. **Error Simulation**: Test various failure modes including network failures, API errors, and storage corruption
3. **Concurrency Testing**: Test race conditions, async operation ordering, and resource cleanup
4. **Memory Testing**: Monitor for leaks in long-running operations and cleanup scenarios
5. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions, especially between authentication and API services

### Risk Mitigation

**Highest Risk**: BackgroundService and ContentManager failures could render the extension unusable
**Medium Risk**: Authentication failures could lock users out of GitHub operations  
**Lower Risk**: Analytics and storage issues are generally recoverable but impact user experience

Each file requires comprehensive testing with particular attention to error handling, async operation management, and resource cleanup to ensure robust extension operation across various failure scenarios.
