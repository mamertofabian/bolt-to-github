Risk Mitigation Recommendations

Immediate Actions (This Sprint)

1. Set up comprehensive test infrastructure for Chrome extension testing
2. Create integration test harnesses for GitHub API and Chrome extension APIs
3. Establish behavior-focused testing standards and documentation
4. Begin Priority 1 testing with BackgroundService.ts

Short-term Actions (Next 2 Sprints)

1. Complete Priority 1 testing for critical untested components
2. Refactor brittle implementation tests to behavior-focused approach
3. Set up continuous integration with comprehensive test coverage reporting
4. Establish performance benchmarks for critical paths

Medium-term Actions (3-6 Months)

1. Achieve 80%+ test coverage for all business logic
2. Implement end-to-end user journey testing
3. Set up automated security testing for authentication flows
4. Create comprehensive regression test suite

Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. Over-mocking: Use real implementations where possible
2. Implementation details testing: Focus on user-observable behavior
3. Brittle CSS/DOM structure tests: Test functionality, not structure
4. Missing error scenarios: Test failure paths as thoroughly as success paths

This comprehensive analysis provides a clear roadmap for systematic improvement of test coverage, focusing on the highest-risk, highest-impact areas first while establishing
sustainable testing practices for long-term maintainability.
