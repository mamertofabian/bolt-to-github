mamertofabian: Do an audit to the current project against clean code principles (including SOLID) and modern chrome extension APIs and best practices published by Google, and see what improvements can be made. One thing I know is missing is unit testing but there could be others that should be done first to enable testability and maintainability.

# Code Audit: Bolt to GitHub Chrome Extension

Based on the provided code excerpts, I'll conduct an audit against clean code principles, SOLID, and modern Chrome extension best practices.

## Strengths

1. **Well-organized project structure**

   - Clear separation between components, services, and types
   - Follows modern frontend architecture patterns

2. **TypeScript usage**

   - Strong typing throughout the codebase
   - Interface definitions in types.ts

3. **Modern UI Framework**

   - Svelte components with proper separation of concerns
   - Components follow single responsibility principle

4. **Chrome Extensions API v3**
   - Using latest manifest v3 format
   - Proper background/content script separation

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. SOLID Principle Violations

#### Single Responsibility Principle

- `UIManager` has too many responsibilities (UI updates, button creation, event handling, status management)
- `GitHubService` handles too many concerns (validation, repo operations, file operations)

#### Open/Closed Principle

- Services like `GitHubService` could use strategy patterns for extensibility
- UI components lack composition patterns for extension without modification

#### Dependency Inversion

- Direct instantiation of services inside components creates tight coupling:
  ```svelte
  const githubService = new GitHubService(token);
  ```
- Should use dependency injection or service locator pattern

### 2. Error Handling

- Inconsistent error handling patterns across the codebase
- Some functions catch errors but don't provide meaningful context for debugging:
  ```typescript
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load repos:', error);
  }
  ```
- Missing centralized error tracking/reporting system

### 3. Testing

- No evidence of unit tests, integration tests, or e2e tests
- Code structure needs adjustment to support testability:
  - More dependency injection
  - Separation of side effects from pure functions
  - Mocking strategies for Chrome API

### 4. Modern Chrome Extension Best Practices

#### Service Worker Usage

- Consider migrating to service worker pattern for background processes
- Current approach may be impacted by Chrome's upcoming background context limitations

#### Permission Model

- Could implement more granular permission requests rather than requesting all at startup
- Consider using `optional_permissions` where appropriate

#### Manifest V3 Optimizations

- Review use of extension contexts for future compatibility
- Explore Content Security Policy improvements

### 5. Code Duplication

- Duplicate validation logic across components
- Multiple implementations of GitHub API calls with similar patterns
- Token validation logic duplicated in components and services

### 6. State Management

- Reliance on Chrome storage API directly from components creates coupling
- No clear separation between UI state and application state
- Consider a centralized state management approach (Svelte stores or similar)

### 7. Security Considerations

- Token handling could be improved with more secure storage options
- Validation of user inputs before GitHub API calls is inconsistent
- Consider implementing Content Security Policy headers

### 8. Performance

- Large components may impact performance (e.g., some Svelte components >300 lines)
- Potential memory leaks from event listeners not being cleaned up properly
- No debouncing on some input validations

## Recommended Improvements

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Implement dependency injection**

   - Create a service provider pattern for components to consume services
   - Refactor components to accept services via props or context

2. **Refactor large classes to follow SRP**

   - Break down `UIManager` into smaller, focused classes
   - Extract distinct responsibilities from `GitHubService`

3. **Add unit testing framework**

   - Set up Jest or Vitest configuration
   - Start with testing pure utility functions
   - Add mock implementations of Chrome APIs for testing

4. **Implement state management**
   - Use Svelte stores for application state
   - Separate UI state from business logic

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Error handling system**

   - Create consistent error handling patterns
   - Add error boundaries in UI components
   - Implement structured logging

2. **Service worker migration**

   - Adapt background scripts to new service worker model
   - Ensure compatibility with Chrome's changing background context model

3. **API abstraction layer**

   - Create a cleaner separation between Chrome API usage and business logic
   - Implement adapters for testability

4. **Performance optimizations**
   - Code splitting for lazy loading components
   - Optimize UI rendering performance

### Long-term Considerations

1. **E2E testing with Playwright**

   - Test actual extension behavior in browser context
   - Create automated workflows for regression testing

2. **CI/CD pipeline improvements**

   - Automated testing on PR
   - Version management and release automation

3. **Feature flags system**
   - Enable gradual rollout of new features
   - A/B testing capability for UI improvements

## Conclusion

The Bolt to GitHub extension is well-structured but would benefit from improvements to support testability, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles. The most urgent priorities are implementing dependency injection, adding unit tests, and refactoring large classes to better follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
