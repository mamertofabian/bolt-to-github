## ðŸ“˜ About This Document

This document tracks unit test files that violate the guidelines in [unit-testing-rules.md](./unit-testing-rules.md). These are tests for services, utilities, managers, and other non-UI code.

**For Svelte component tests:** Component tests follow different rules and are tracked separately in [component-tests-requiring-review.md](./component-tests-requiring-review.md).

Replaced setTimeout in token renewal test with vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(50). Removed entire "Performance Scenarios" describe block (2 tests) that measured actual execution time (Date.now() before/after with duration assertions like toBeGreaterThan(900ms)). These performance tests violated non-deterministic time rules by testing implementation details (actual setTimeout delays) rather than behavior. The comprehensive test suite still maintains strong coverage with 39 tests across: Constructor and Initialization (3), PAT Authentication (5), GitHub App Authentication (4), Authentication Failures (3), Repository Operations (11), Issue Management (6), Feedback System (1), Repository Cloning (2), Error Handling (3 - Network, Rate Limiting, Permissions), Legacy Methods (1).

Updated ZipHandlerMocks.ts to use FIXED_UNIX_TIME for rate limit time checking and deterministic counters (treeCounter, commitCounter) instead of Date.now() for SHA generation. Added vi.useRealTimers() in afterEach to restore real timers. Reviewed tests for implementation violations - all tests properly verify behavior through public API (GitHub API interactions, status updates, error handling). Tests verify API call ordering (blobsâ†’treeâ†’commitâ†’ref update) which is required GitHub API contract behavior. All 23 tests pass with deterministic time controls.**
- [x] `src/services/__tests__/GitHubComparisonService.test.ts` - **COMPLETED: Fixed excessive mocking by reducing from 36 mocks to 1 mock (UnifiedGitHubService - external GitHub API).

Tests now use real implementations of these services. Fixed non-deterministic time by using vi.useFakeTimers() with FIXED_TIME constant (2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z). Removed implementation testing: eliminated tests checking private githubService property, removed tests verifying OperationStateManager method calls (startOperation, completeOperation, failOperation). Tests now focus exclusively on observable behavior through public API: file comparison results (added/modified/deleted/unchanged status detection), content normalization (line ending handling), progress callbacks, error handling, repository data structure. Improved from 47 tests checking mock calls/private properties to 26 focused tests verifying actual comparison algorithm behavior and edge cases. All tests verify final state and actual data changes instead of implementation details. All 26 tests pass.**
- [x] `src/services/__tests__/UnifiedGitHubService.working.test.ts` - **COMPLETED: Fixed non-deterministic time by removing "Performance" test block that measured actual execution time using Date.now().

Replaced custom advanceTime() helper function with vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(). Updated all test fixtures (GitHubAppServiceTestFixtures.ts, GitHubAppServiceTestHelpers.ts) to use FIXED_TIME constant instead of Date.now() calls. Removed implementation testing from concurrent token refresh test - now verifies all requests get same renewed token instead of counting fetch calls. Fixed time drift test to properly test boundary conditions (6 minutes â†’ advance 61s â†’ should need renewal at 299s remaining). Tests now verify observable behavior: OAuth flow (success, errors, network failures), token lifecycle (retrieval, automatic refresh, renewal failures), expiry detection (needsRenewal with time boundaries), error classification (NO_GITHUB_APP, TOKEN_EXPIRED_NO_REFRESH, TOKEN_RENEWAL_FAILED), storage management (config store/retrieve/clear, concurrent operations), edge cases (malformed tokens, storage key formats, race conditions).

Replaced Date mocking (vi.spyOn(global, 'Date')) with deterministic time controls. Updated date calculations to use FIXED_TIME constant: 15 days ago = FIXED_TIME - 15 * 24 _ 60 _ 60 _ 1000, 35 days ago = FIXED_TIME - 35 _ 24 _ 60 _ 60 \_ 1000.

All 16 tests pass with deterministic time controls.**
- [x] `src/services/__tests__/AuthenticationStrategyFactory.test.ts` - **COMPLETED: Refactored from 40 excessive mocks (Chrome storage, strategy instances with partial implementations, factory methods) to only 2 minimal mocks (Chrome storage API - external dependency). Removed all implementation testing: eliminated tests verifying mock calls (toHaveBeenCalled, toHaveBeenCalledWith), removed tests checking createStrategy/getDefaultStrategy method calls, stopped spying on factory methods. Tests now focus exclusively on observable behavior through public API: singleton pattern verification, strategy creation (correct types, caching per type, cache clearing), default strategy selection (GitHub App for new users), authentication method preference persistence (save/retrieve from storage, switching methods), token-specific strategy creation (PAT with token, GitHub App with user token), error handling (unsupported types, storage failures). Improved from 56 tests checking mocks to 20 comprehensive tests verifying actual behavior (return values, instance equality, storage state). All tests use real PATAuthenticationStrategy and GitHubAppAuthenticationStrategy instances instead of mocks. All 20 tests pass with behavior-focused coverage.**

## Common Violations

1. **Non-deterministic time usage:** 27 files (all completed âœ…) â†’ Fixed with `vi.useFakeTimers()`
2. **Excessive mocking (>20 mocks):** 23 files (all completed âœ…) â†’ Used real implementations where possible
3. **Implementation testing:** 18 files (all completed âœ…) â†’ Focused on behavior, not implementation
4. **Testing implementation details:** 6 files (all completed âœ…) â†’ Tested through public APIs only
5. **Testing ratio issues:** 3 files (all completed âœ…) â†’ Added comprehensive behavior assertions
