Create comprehensive test fixtures for $ARGUMENTS:

1. Analyze the data structures and dependencies for the specified module
2. Create realistic test data that covers normal, edge, and error cases
3. Build test doubles that accurately reflect real behavior
4. Set up controlled test environments instead of extensive mocking
5. Create helper functions for test setup and teardown
6. Ensure fixtures are reusable across multiple test files

Focus on creating fixtures that reveal actual usage patterns and potential bugs.
