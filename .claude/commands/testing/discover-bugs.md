Create comprehensive error condition tests for $ARGUMENTS:

1. Test all failure scenarios (network errors, authentication failures, quota limits)
2. Test boundary conditions (empty projects, large files, special characters)
3. Test concurrent operations (multiple downloads, simultaneous pushes)
4. Test data corruption scenarios (malformed ZIP files, incomplete downloads)
5. Test permission edge cases (repository access changes, token expiration)
6. Test browser compatibility issues (different Chrome versions, extensions conflicts)

Focus on scenarios that could realistically happen in production.
