Initialize TDD workflow for $ARGUMENTS:

1. Create test file structure following our conventions
2. Write comprehensive failing tests based on requirements
3. Run tests and confirm they fail with expected errors
4. DO NOT implement functionality yet
5. Create separate commit for tests: "test: add tests for $ARGUMENTS"
6. Output test file paths and summary

Remember: RED phase only - tests must fail initially!
