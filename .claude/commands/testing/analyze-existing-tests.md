Analyze current test coverage and identify gaps:

1. Review all existing test files in src/\*\*/**tests**/
2. Map tested vs untested modules
3. Identify critical business logic without tests
4. Find areas with implementation-focused tests that should be behavior-focused
5. Highlight potential bug-prone areas based on complexity
6. Generate testing priority matrix (High impact, Low coverage = Priority 1)

Output detailed analysis with recommendations for testing strategy.
