Create user journey tests for $ARGUMENTS workflow:

1. **Journey Mapping**:

   - Start state: User opens extension
   - Actions: All user interactions in sequence
   - Expectations: State changes and side effects
   - End state: Expected outcome

2. **Test Structure**:

   ```javascript
   describe('User Journey: $ARGUMENTS', () => {
     it('should complete full workflow successfully', async () => {
       // Given: Initial state setup
       // When: User performs actions
       // Then: Verify behavior and state changes
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Focus Areas**:

   - State transitions and data flow
   - User feedback and error messages
   - External API interactions
   - Storage persistence
   - Cross-component communication

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Network failures during operations
   - Invalid user inputs
   - Permission denied scenarios
   - Concurrent operations
