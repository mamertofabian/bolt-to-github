Systematically expand test coverage for $ARGUMENTS:

1. **Coverage Analysis**:

   - Run existing tests with coverage reports
   - Identify untested code paths and functions
   - Focus on business logic and user-facing features

2. **Behavior-Based Test Addition**:

   - For each untested area, ask "What behavior should this enable?"
   - Write tests for the expected behavior
   - Let test failures guide understanding of actual behavior

3. **Integration Boundary Testing**:

   - Test all points where components interact
   - Verify data transformation and validation
   - Test error propagation and recovery

4. **Real-World Scenario Testing**:
   - Use actual GitHub repositories for testing
   - Test with real network conditions
   - Verify behavior under load and stress
