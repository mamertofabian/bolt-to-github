# Testing Master Plan - Bolt to GitHub Extension

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Create comprehensive behavior-focused tests to discover and fix bugs
- **Approach**: Multi-agent testing with minimal mocking
- **Timeline**: 5-day intensive implementation

## Phase Status

- [ ] Phase 1: Assessment and Foundation (Day 1)
- [ ] Phase 2: Core Business Logic Testing (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Phase 3: Chrome Extension Integration Testing (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Phase 4: Bug Discovery Testing (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Phase 5: Documentation and Maintenance (Day 5)

## Critical Behaviors to Test (Priority Order)

1. **AUTH-01**: GitHub authentication flow (PAT + GitHub App)
2. **ZIP-01**: ZIP file processing and extraction
3. **SYNC-01**: Complete project sync to GitHub
4. **SETTINGS-01**: Settings persistence across sessions
5. **ERROR-01**: Error handling and recovery

## Test Coverage Goals

- [ ] 80%+ coverage of core business logic
- [ ] All critical user workflows tested
- [ ] All error conditions tested
- [ ] Performance edge cases covered

## Agent Assignments

- **Agent-Core**: Business logic testing (GitHub services, ZIP processing)
- **Agent-Integration**: Chrome extension integration testing
- **Agent-Discovery**: Bug discovery and edge case testing
- **Agent-Coord**: Coordination and documentation

## Current Test Coverage Analysis

**Overall Status**: 24 test suites, 493 tests passing
**Critical Gaps Identified**:

- UnifiedGitHubService: 8.94% coverage (CRITICAL - main service)
- zipHandler.ts: 0% coverage (CRITICAL - ZIP processing)
- PATAuthenticationStrategy: 0% coverage (HIGH - auth flow)
- GitHubAppAuthenticationStrategy: Not tested (HIGH - auth flow)
- AnalyticsService: Not tested (MEDIUM)
- DownloadService: Not tested (HIGH - core functionality)

## 5-Day Implementation Timeline

### Day 1 (Foundation & Assessment)

- **Morning**: Complete coverage analysis of critical paths
- **Afternoon**: Set up behavior-focused test infrastructure
- **Target**: Establish testing patterns and mock strategies

### Day 2 (Core Business Logic - Part 1)

- **Focus**: UnifiedGitHubService comprehensive testing
- **Priority**: Authentication flows (PAT + GitHub App)
- **Target**: 70%+ coverage on auth critical paths

### Day 3 (Core Business Logic - Part 2)

- **Focus**: ZIP processing and file handling
- **Priority**: zipHandler.ts and DownloadService
- **Target**: Complete ZIP workflow coverage

### Day 4 (Integration & Edge Cases)

- **Focus**: Chrome extension integration testing
- **Priority**: Content script behavior and state management
- **Target**: Cross-component workflow testing

### Day 5 (Bug Discovery & Polish)

- **Focus**: Error scenarios and edge case discovery
- **Priority**: Performance testing and failure recovery
- **Target**: Comprehensive error condition coverage

## Top 5 Critical Behaviors (Updated Priority)

1. **AUTH-FLOW**: Complete authentication workflow (PAT â†’ GitHub App migration)

   - Files: UnifiedGitHubService, PATAuthenticationStrategy, GitHubAppAuthenticationStrategy
   - Current Coverage: ~5% overall
   - Risk: HIGH - Core functionality

2. **ZIP-PROCESSING**: ZIP download, extraction, and file processing

   - Files: zipHandler.ts, DownloadService, FileService
   - Current Coverage: 0% (zipHandler), 75% (FileService)
   - Risk: CRITICAL - Primary feature

3. **REPO-SYNC**: Repository creation and file synchronization

   - Files: RepositoryService, RepoCloneService
   - Current Coverage: 75% (both services)
   - Risk: MEDIUM - Well tested but complex

4. **SETTINGS-PERSISTENCE**: Settings management across sessions

   - Files: settings.ts, various stores
   - Current Coverage: 4% (settings.ts)
   - Risk: HIGH - User experience

5. **ERROR-RECOVERY**: Error handling and user feedback
   - Files: RateLimitHandler, NotificationManager
   - Current Coverage: 80% (RateLimit), Good (Notifications)
   - Risk: MEDIUM - Mostly covered
