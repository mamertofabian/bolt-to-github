# Testing Architecture & Approach Decisions

## Decision Log

### Decision 001: Scratchpad Coordination System

**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Decided By**: Primary Claude  
**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
**Impact**: Foundation

**Decision**:
Implement comprehensive scratchpad system for coordinating testing work across multiple Claude instances.

**Rationale**:

- Multiple agents will work on testing over time
- Need persistent coordination mechanism
- Prevent duplicate work and ensure continuity
- Track progress and discoveries systematically

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Simple text files with less structure
- Git-based coordination only
- No formal coordination system

**Implementation**:
Created `.claude/scratchpads/` directory with structured templates for:

- Master planning
- Current focus tracking
- Discovery logging
- Test inventory
- Inter-agent coordination
- Decision documentation

**Review Date**: 2025-01-13 (1 week)

### Decision 002: Testing Strategy Approach

**Date**: TBD  
**Decided By**: TBD  
**Status**: üìã PENDING  
**Impact**: High

**Decision**:
[To be determined - overall testing strategy]

**Options Under Consideration**:

- Bottom-up (unit tests first, then integration)
- Top-down (E2E tests first, then break down)
- Risk-based (highest risk areas first)
- Coverage-based (lowest coverage areas first)

**Factors to Consider**:

- Existing test quality and coverage
- Critical business paths
- Development team velocity
- Risk tolerance

**Next Steps**:

- Analyze existing test suite
- Identify critical paths
- Assess current coverage gaps
- Choose approach based on analysis

## Architecture Decisions

### Testing Framework Choices

**Status**: ‚úÖ EXISTING  
**Decision**: Continue with Jest + @testing-library approach  
**Rationale**: Already established, good TypeScript support, comprehensive mocking

### Mock Strategy

**Status**: üìã TO_DECIDE  
**Options**:

- Minimal mocking (prefer real implementations)
- Comprehensive mocking (mock all dependencies)
- Hybrid approach (mock external APIs, use real internal services)

### Test Organization

**Status**: üìã TO_DECIDE  
**Options**:

- Co-located tests (`__tests__` folders alongside source)
- Centralized test directory
- Mixed approach based on test type

### Coverage Targets

**Status**: üìã TO_DECIDE  
**Considerations**:

- Current coverage levels
- Critical path identification
- Resource constraints
- Quality vs. speed trade-offs

---

## Process Decisions

### Development Workflow

**Status**: üìã TO_DECIDE  
**Options**:

- TDD (write tests first)
- Traditional (write tests after implementation)
- Hybrid (tests for new features, coverage for existing)

### Test Maintenance

**Status**: üìã TO_DECIDE  
**Considerations**:

- Who maintains tests long-term
- Test refactoring strategy
- Handling flaky tests
- Test documentation standards

### Quality Gates

**Status**: üìã TO_DECIDE  
**Options**:

- Coverage percentage requirements
- Test reliability thresholds
- Performance requirements
- Code review requirements for tests

---

## Tool Decisions

### Testing Tools

**Status**: ‚úÖ EXISTING  
**Current Stack**:

- Jest for test runner
- @testing-library/jest-dom for assertions
- ts-jest for TypeScript support
- jsdom for DOM simulation

### Additional Tools Considered

**Status**: üìã EVALUATION  
**Options**:

- Playwright for E2E testing
- Storybook for component testing
- MSW for API mocking
- Testing Library extensions

## Pending Decisions

### High Priority Decisions Needed

1. **Overall Testing Strategy** - Need to analyze existing tests first
2. **Coverage Targets** - Depends on current state analysis
3. **Test Organization** - Should align with existing patterns

### Medium Priority Decisions Needed

1. **Mock Strategy** - Can be decided per test suite
2. **Additional Tooling** - Based on gap analysis
3. **Quality Gates** - After baseline is established

### Low Priority Decisions Needed

1. **Long-term Maintenance** - After implementation is complete
2. **Advanced Testing Features** - Performance, accessibility, etc.
